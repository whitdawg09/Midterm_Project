<h2>Fun Facts!</h2>
<li>Ancient Survivors: Sharks have been around for over 400 million years, even before dinosaurs roamed the Earth.</li>

<li>Multiple Rows of Teeth: Sharks can have up to 3,000 teeth at any given time, arranged in multiple rows. When a tooth falls out, another moves forward to replace it.</li>

<li>Some Don’t Sleep: Unlike most animals, many shark species can't stop swimming, or they'll sink. This is because some sharks need to move to force water over their gills to breathe.</li>

<li>Electric Sensitivity: Sharks have an incredible sense of electroreception, allowing them to detect the electric fields produced by other animals, helping them hunt in murky water or even buried prey.</li>

<li>Whale Sharks are Gentle Giants: Despite being the largest fish species, growing up to 40 feet long, whale sharks are filter feeders, meaning they eat tiny plankton and aren’t dangerous to humans.</li>
