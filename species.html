        <p>
            Hammerhead sharks are one of the most unique and recognizable species of shark, mainly due to their distinctive hammer-shaped head. This comes with many evolutionary benifits for the species. The wide spacing of their eyes gives hammerheads a more panoramic view, helping them detect prey from a greater distance. Hammerhead sharks are found in warm, temperate, and tropical oceans. Some areas where hammerheads are commonly seen include the coasts of Hawaii, Florida, and the Galápagos Islands. Hammerheads are carnivorous and feed on a variety of marine animals, including fish, squid, octopuses, and crustaceans.
